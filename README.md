Assignment 3 - Unit Converter

The CONVERTER app is a very basic android app that allows users to convert units from the international metric system to english system and vice versa.

In this first release it provides the three most common english measurements (Miles, Fahrenheit and Pounds).

The minimum required SDK to run this app is Android 2.2 (Froyo).

The app uses a very intuitive interface that is divided in three sections (horizontally). The upper section is responsible of the Distance conversion, the middle section for Temperature conversions and the lower section for Weight conversions.

To convert a value, users just have to do two simple steps:
- First, type the value on the text field located to the right of the desired activity.
- Second, click on the radio button corresponding to the desired unit.

The converted value will be shown on the same text field the user typed the original value.

If the user wants to convert a value to a unit that is already checked, it is needed to click on the radio button to run the conversion algorithm.  

Example:
To convert 68°F to Celsius a user has to type 68 to the right of label Temperature and then click on the Celsius radio button (even though it is already selected).
The value 20.0 will replace the original provided value 68.
